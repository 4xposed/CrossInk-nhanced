> **This is a personal fork of [CrossInk](https://github.com/uxjulia/CrossInk)** with Anki support and OPDS Servers with .xtc files.

### Supported Devices

- Xteink X3
- Xteink X4
- Xteink X4 Pro
- Xteink X4 Classic
- Seeed Studio Sticky

## What's different in this fork

My goal with this fork was to extend CrossInk to add support for:
- Anki decks for langauge learning.
- Support OPDS Servers which serve files in .xtc format.

## Installation

The fastest way to install Crossink is by using Inky, Crossink's web companion app: https://inky.crossink.dev/#flash-tools

Download a `firmware-*.bin` from the [releases page](https://github.com/uxjulia/CrossInk/releases), then flash it with the web installer or command line.

See [Installation](./docs/installation.md) for step-by-step flashing and revert instructions.

## Development quick start

CrossInk uses PlatformIO for building and flashing firmware. See [Getting Started](./docs/development/getting-started.md) for prerequisites, clone setup, and validation commands.

### Nix/NixOS

Nix/NixOS users can enter the development shell with either `nix develop` (flakes) or `nix-shell`:

```bash
nix develop -f nix
# or
nix-shell nix
```

To flash a connected ESP32-C3 device, enable PlatformIO's udev rules in your NixOS configuration:

```nix
services.udev.packages = with pkgs; [ platformio-core.udev ];
```

After rebuilding the system configuration, reconnect the device or reload udev rules.

### Build / flash / monitor

Connect your device to your computer via a USB cable. Before the first build, initialize the repository's submodules (including `freeink-sdk`):

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Then flash the firmware using the correct environment for the device. The `default` environment is for the X3/X4 devices. ESP32-S3 devices have their own named environments.

```sh
pio run -e default --target upload
```

If PlatformIO reports `PackageException: Can not create a symbolic link for freeink-sdk/libs/hardware/BatteryMonitor, not a directory`, the `freeink-sdk` submodule is not initialized. Run the submodule command above and retry.

See [Testing and Debugging](./docs/development/testing-debugging.md) for serial logging, simulator checks, static analysis, and bug-report guidance.
